        <article>
        <p>It is alright to sometimes be without nothing to do. We can take it as a resting period but this cannot last for long as we eventually get bored and look out for something to do to keep busy.</p>
        <p>No one wants to be seen as a lazy girl supporting the saying that an idle hand is the devils's workshop. We will always need to find the opportunity to do something no matter how small or big.</p>
        <p>Opportunities are always around us. We do not need to look too far to harness them whether it is rendering an helping hand to the little kid next door or helping out with siblings' assignments.</p>
        <p>The opportunities are endless. </p>
        <p>No matter how you see opportunities, just remember that it is always a way to add something of value to another.</p>
        <p>Look out for the opportunities around you today and you will be glad you did.</p>
